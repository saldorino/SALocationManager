# SALocationManager
SALocationManager was created as plug and play module to handle user location updates. Although I'm not actively working on this, new features will be implemeted as I require them.

## Features
- Supports multiple location updates listeners.
- Location filtering by maximum age and horizontal accuracy.
- Supports continuous location updates and listeners with maximum retry count.
- Handles authorization status automatically and presents feedback to the user when appropriate (feedback can be turned off through a BOOL property in locations update listener)


## Planned upgrades
- Significant location change updates.
- Geographic and beacon monitoring.
- iBeacon ranging.
- Heading updates.
